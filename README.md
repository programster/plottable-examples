This is an incredibly basic self-reference set of examples that I am creating as I learn to use Plottable. Feel free to use them if you find them useful in any way. Each directory should be a completely self contained area with everything it needs for a working example. You should be able to just double click the index.html file and see the example in all its glory. There is no need to worry about finding and copying shared liraries etc.
